# Backend Developer Role Document

## Role Overview
The Backend Developer plays a crucial role in the Personal Finance Tracker project by building and maintaining the server-side logic that powers the application. This role focuses on creating a robust and secure backend using Node.js and Express.js, ensuring that user data is handled efficiently and securely. The Backend Developer will work closely with the Frontend Developer to provide the necessary APIs for user authentication and data management, enabling a seamless user experience.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Set up the server using Node.js and Express
- **Example**: Configure the server environment, including middleware for parsing JSON requests and setting up CORS for cross-origin resource sharing.
- **Practical Guidance**: Use Express.js to create a basic server structure. For instance:
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  app.use(express.json());
  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
  });
  ```

### 2. Develop RESTful APIs for user authentication and data handling
- **Example**: Create endpoints for user registration, login, and transaction management (CRUD operations).
- **Practical Guidance**: Implement routes for user authentication:
  ```javascript
  app.post('/api/register', (req, res) => {
    // Handle user registration logic
  });
  
  app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
    // Handle user login logic
  });
  ```

### 3. Manage and connect the database for storing user data
- **Example**: Use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user profiles and transaction records.
- **Practical Guidance**: Set up a connection to the database and define schemas/models for users and transactions.

## Technical Requirements
- **Node.js**: Proficiency in building server-side applications with Node.js.
- **Express.js**: Knowledge of Express.js for creating RESTful APIs and middleware.
- **Database Management**: Familiarity with database systems (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and ORMs (e.g., Mongoose, Sequelize) for data modeling and querying.
- **Security Practices**: Understanding of user authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, bcrypt) to ensure secure data handling.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional Node.js server with Express.js.
- RESTful API documentation outlining endpoints for user authentication and transaction management.
- Database schema and connection setup for user and transaction data.
- Unit tests for API endpoints to ensure reliability and security.

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Developer**: Collaborate on API contracts to ensure the frontend can successfully interact with the backend. Regularly communicate about data formats and expected responses.
- **UI/UX Designer**: Work together to understand user flows that require backend support, ensuring that the API meets the needs of the user interface.

## Development Workflow
- **Branching Strategy**: Use Git for version control with a branching strategy such as Git Flow. Create feature branches for new API endpoints or database changes.
- **Code Review Process**: Conduct peer reviews for all code changes to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.
- **Testing Approach**: Implement unit tests using frameworks like Mocha or Jest to validate API functionality and ensure that new changes do not break existing features.

## Technical Decisions
- Choose the appropriate database technology based on project requirements, considering factors like scalability and ease of use.
- Decide on the authentication method (e.g., JWT vs. sessions) based on security needs and user experience.
- Determine the structure of the API responses and error handling strategies to provide clear feedback to the frontend.

## Learning Resources
- **Node.js Documentation**: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/
- **Express.js Documentation**: https://expressjs.com/
- **MongoDB University**: Free courses on MongoDB (https://university.mongodb.com/)
- **RESTful API Design**: Articles and tutorials on best practices for designing RESTful APIs.
- **Testing in Node.js**: Tutorials on using Mocha or Jest for testing Node.js applications.
